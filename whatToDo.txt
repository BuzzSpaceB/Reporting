Major changes made:

1. 	Each function that would normally return a value now has a parameter named "callback".
	Node.js is purely asynchronous, so if one would return the value it might not yet exists when it is used.
	Therefore in node when recieving any result from a function, one passes the function that would use the result to the function returning said result.
	When you would usually say "return x;", you now say "callback(x);".
	So when the higher level people call your function, they would also provide the callback function to your function.
	But, we did implement the callbacks already, so you dont need to worry about it.

2.	We linked all our files in the Reporting.js file in the repo.

3.	We created a file for unit testing in the repo, that calls gets all the functions from Reporting.js.

If you want to test your code:

1.	Make a folder locally on your computer
2.	Paste package.json in the folder
3.	Open command prompt/terminal in the folder that you created
4.	enter the command: "npm install"
5. 	Wait for it to download and install all the modules (takes a while)
6.	Open the unit testing file
7.	Make sure that the test[your function here] method calls Reporting.[your function here](). And if it needs to display a return value, 
	use consolePrintCallback as the callback function (last parameter), to print the result in the console.
8.	In the section where it says "Uncomment your function here to test it:", uncomment the function that you want to test. All uncommented functions will execute
9.	In cmd/terminal enter the command "node [your path to repo here]\UnitTests.js"
10.	Evaluate results
